# Spine Toolbox

## Unstable bundles for Windows

Unzip and go! Bundles are zip files that contain ``spinetoolbox.exe`` executable
and everything you need to run Spine Toolbox.

The bundle also comes with a Python interpreter to help you get started.
Note, that to keep the interpreter light-weight, it is missing components like ``pip`` and ``venv``.
A separate Python installation is recommended if you need a full-blown Python for your Tools.

### 0.8 (development version)

Consider taking backups of your projects and Spine databases if you are upgrading from version 0.7.
