# Spine Toolbox

## Relocatable bundles for Windows

Unzip and go! Bundles are zip files that contain ``spinetoolbox.exe`` executable
and everything you need to run Spine Toolbox.
They can be unzipped anywhere on your system; no other installation steps are necessary.

The bundle also comes with a Python interpreter to help you get started.
Note, that to keep the interpreter light-weight, it is missing components like ``pip`` and ``venv``.
A separate Python installation is recommended if you need a full-blown Python for your Tools.

For other installation methods,
see Toolbox [installation](https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
